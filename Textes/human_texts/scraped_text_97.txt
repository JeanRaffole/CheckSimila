He served as Commander of the Southern Command from 1962–1965 and as Head of the Mossad from 1968–1974. He was also the CEO of Oil Refineries Ltd. from 1976–1990.

Zamir was born in Łódź, Poland. His parents were Shmuel Moshe Zarzhevsky, a textile industrialist, and Sarah. Due to an economic crisis in Poland, the family immigrated to Eretz Yisrael when Zamir was nine months old, and he grew up as a native-born Israeli. The family lived in Tel Aviv, and Zamir, following his brother David, attended the boys' school "Ahad Ha'am".[3] His older sister, Tzipora, attended the girls' school "Talpiot." His father worked as a wagon driver for the Israel Electric Corporation, transporting electric poles from Tel Aviv to Petah Tikva with his two horses. His mother opened a popular workers' restaurant near the electric company. After moving from Ahad Ha'am Street to Balfour Street, Zamir formed friendships with the "Playground Gang." Later, he enlisted with them in the Palmach.

In 1942, Zamir joined the Palmach and served in Company D. In 1944, he participated in the platoon commanders' course with Uzi Narkiss and Chaim Bar-Lev.[4] Following the course, he was appointed a platoon commander at Ayelet HaShahar in Company T. In 1946, he was arrested by the British police during a Palmach operation involving Aliyah Bet from Syria, and he was detained at the Latrun detention camp for ten months. After his release, he returned to the Palmach, becoming deputy commander and instructor of the Second Battalion. At the start of the War of Independence, he established the Palmach Sixth Battalion, responsible for securing convoys to Jerusalem, and served as its commander.[5] Eighteen soldiers from the battalion, along with seventeen soldiers from the Hish, formed the Lamed Heh Convoy, whose fighters fell while defending Gush Etzion.[6] Zamir led the Navi Daniel Convoy to Gush Etzion and, when the convoy was attacked on its return to Jerusalem, he instructed all capable drivers to return to Gush Etzion, accompanying them while leaving command of the convoy to one of the platoon commanders. Under his leadership, the battalion fought in Operation Danny, Operation Ha-Har, and Operation Horev.

In 1949, Zamir was appointed as one of the first instructors in the IDF's Battalion Commanders' Course. Following his participation, against orders, in the Palmach Conference, he received a severe reprimand from the IDF Chief of Staff, Yaakov Dori.[7] A year later, he was promoted to instructor in an advanced course for senior officers. Between 1951 and 1953, he commanded the Givati Brigade. In 1953, he went to England to attend the Staff College in Camberley. Upon his return in 1954, he was appointed commander of the IDF Infantry School. In 1956, he joined the General Staff as a senior commander in the training branch and, during Operation Kadesh, commanded the Carmeli Brigade. In 1957, he took a study leave, studying geography and Middle Eastern history and earning a bachelor's degree in humanities at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1960, he was appointed head of the IDF Training Department in the General Staff,[8] and in October 1961, he was promoted to the rank of Major General.[9] Between 1962 and 1965, he served as Commander of the Southern Command,[10] a period marked by infiltrations for theft and smuggling.[11] Upon completing his term, he was sent in July 1966 to the United Kingdom and Scandinavia as the Israeli Defense Attaché and head of the Ministry of Defense Mission,[12] a position he held until 1968. During the Six-Day War, he was involved in securing arms and equipment for the IDF.[citation needed]

On 1 September 1968, Zamir replaced Meir Amit as the head of "Mossad" and served in this role until 1 September 1974.[13] Key events the Mossad was involved in during his tenure include:

In the year leading up to the Yom Kippur War, Zamir believed there was a possibility of war initiated by Egypt, contrary to the IDF Intelligence's (Aman) assessment. On 4–5 October 1973, Ashraf Marwan, a senior Mossad source, provided Zamir with information regarding the imminent attack. Zamir met with Marwan in London, where Marwan explicitly warned that war would start on Yom Kippur. This intelligence led to Zamir's urgent warning to the Prime Minister and military leadership.[16]

Throughout the war, Zamir's influence grew among decision-makers, while Aman’s standing declined.[17] Zamir served in the military echelon of the war cabinet formed by Golda Meir, actively participating in daily meetings until the war ended. He later accused Aman Chief Eli Zeira of intelligence failure, leading to a significant investigation.[18]

In late 1974, Zamir became Chairman of Solel Boneh.[19] He managed Solel Boneh until January 1976, when he resigned due to internal conflicts.[20] From 1976–1990, he served as CEO of Oil Refineries Ltd..[21]

Zamir was a member of several public bodies, including the Press Council.[22] In 1990, he headed the "Zamir Committee" investigating events on the Temple Mount.[citation needed]
