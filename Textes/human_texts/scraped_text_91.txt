Yemeni Houthi militants performed a drone attack on Israel on 19 July 2024, hitting an apartment building near the US Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv, Israel's economic center[2] in Ben Yehuda Street.[3] The drone strike killed one person in his apartment building, and injured 10 others.[1][4] The drone was spotted but not intercepted due to what Israel attributed to human error, with the Houthis asserting that they had developed a drone with the ability to evade the Iron Dome. The air raid siren was also not activated.[5]

The attack is reportedly the first successful one by the Houthis to hit its target, with previous attempts being intercepted by either Israeli defenses or Western allies located in the region.[2] Israeli military responded one day after by striking the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah.[6]

On 19 October 2023, Houthis fired a barrage of rockets and drones into Israeli territory, demanding an end to Israel's invasion of Gaza. These projectiles were intercepted by Israel's Arrow missile defense system, missing their intended targets. Subsequently, the Houthis intensified their attacks on ships they considered associated with Israel or its foreign allies, disrupting one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. In December 2023, the United States and several Western allies launched operations in the Red Sea to thwart attacks on ships originating from Yemeni territory and to ensure the security of shipping routes. Despite these efforts, the campaign largely fell short of its goals.[7]

The Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, stated that the aircraft was a new drone type, named "Jaffa" that was able to fly "undetected through Israel's extensive air defence systems."[5] The drone is suspected by the IDF to have been an Iranian-made Samad-3 modified by the Houthis to carry more fuel (for a longer range) in exchange for a smaller warhead.[8] The drone was spotted but not intercepted. Israel claimed this was due to human error, while the Houthis claimed they had made a drone capable of bypassing the Iron Dome.[4] Likewise, no air raid siren was sounded.[8][9]

According to The Associated Press news agency, the attack marks the first successful one hitting the target with the others being "intercepted by either Israeli defenses or Western allies with forces stationed in the region."[2] Likewise, According to Ibrahim al-Marashi, associate professor at California State University, the Houthi attack marked both a technical and symbolic victory in that it marked the first time the group had entered Israeli territory since  hostilities began in October 2023, evading Israeli air defense systems and causing damage.[7]

Video from the blast site revealed shattered glass scattered across the sidewalks, while onlookers gathered near a building marked by the explosion. The area was cordoned off with police tape. IDF said it had had initiated an investigation into the drone attack causing a "large explosion" near the U.S. embassy office and would determine why the country's air defense systems were not activated to intercept the "aerial target".[2] Houthi militants said that the attack on Tel Aviv as the beginning of the fifth phase of their conflict with Israel.[10]

Hezbollah hailed the event as a victory for the "oppressed Palestinian people" and their fighters. They mentioned that Yemeni fighters were backing the "brave Palestinian fighters" in Gaza, who are "defending all the people and nations of the Arab and Islamic world".[2] Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the attack, stating it further demonstrated the current government's inability to provide security for Israeli citizens.[2]

On 20 July, Israeli aircraft struck military and oil refining facilities at the Hudaydah Port in retaliation.[11][12][13]
