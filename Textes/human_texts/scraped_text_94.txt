It is not clear if the deal establishes full diplomatic relations between the two nations.[1][2] According to Axios reporting on March 10, 2021, "While Israel has presented Sudan with a draft agreement for establishing diplomatic relations, the Sudanese want an endorsement from the Biden administration."[3] The agreement came after the agreements of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates signed with Israel in September 2020.[4] Unlike the latter two, Sudan had sent troops to fight against Israel in major Arab-Israeli wars and considered Israel an enemy state.[5]

On October 19, 2020, President Trump tweeted that he would remove Sudan from the list of countries it considers state sponsors of terrorism as soon as its government had deposited $335 million in promised compensation for victims of the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the USS Cole in 2000, and on October 22, Sudan's information minister said Thursday that the money had been deposited.[20] Sudan had hosted Osama bin Laden in Khartoum between 1991 and 1996.[21]

The Sudanese government approved the repeal of the 1958 boycott of Israel law on April 6, 2021. The decision received the approval of a joint meeting of Sudan's sovereign council and cabinet on April 20, 2021.[27][28]

A joint statement issued by the governments of Israel, Sudan, and the United States said that "The leaders agreed to the normalisation of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,"[29] it went on to state that "In addition, the leaders agreed to begin economic and trade relations, with an initial focus on agriculture." The statement also suggested the possibility of further meetings and agreements, saying that "The leaders also agreed that delegations will meet in the coming weeks to negotiate agreements of cooperation in those areas as well as in agriculture technology, aviation, migration issues and other areas for the benefit of the two peoples."[24]

On January 6, 2021, Sudan officially signed the Abraham Accords Declaration. The signing took place in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, in the presence of US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

As of February 2023, negotiations continue towards normalization.[31] Meanwhile, the ongoing efforts have been condemned by the Sudanese opposition and civil society groups.[32]
