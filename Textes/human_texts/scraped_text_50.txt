A strange situation has come up, and I was hoping somebody can explain what is going on.  Background: I often run AWB against recently created articles to pick up typos etc.  But I was just notified that back in June, I am listed as CREATING a article (Draft:Turkic conquest of Asia Minor (please salt original)).  The page history shows the first edit is me using AWB to fix some typos, but this shows up as a page creation.  I can see that Fram  subsequently moved the original version to Draft and added the "please salt original" to the name.  But why am I shown as creator?  And can I then delete it?

Apparently, this is Wikipedia's current article for improvement ‚Äì and I can help edit it!

But that final exclamation mark in that header pissed me the fuck off. Gabin is one of my screen heroes. I would have done my very utmost to find new sources, and added them to at least the References, or even to the Bibliography with approved citations, templated or not according the article's existing reffing scheme - main non. Je me fous de tout point d'exclamation. C'est tout a fait inutile d'employer tel point, soit r√©portage cit√© d'un expression d'√©clat, un sursaut personnel, un √©ruption d'esprit mal contenu. Mais ce n'est pas ce qu'on veut. A  celui qui a os√© d'√©crire cet invitation: ta m√®re. Point maudit! MinorProphet (talk) 02:11, 14 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]

I am trying to edit the Wikipedia page for Lisa de Leeuw. Everytime I publish it gets reverted. Her Fan-club would like a proper Wikipedia page. prior to my edits it was very short with some false information. It didn't celebrate her legacy at all. What should I do?

The current Israel-Hamas war has spillovers is many countries in the region obviously. In Middle Eastern crisis (2023‚Äìpresent), every theatre is Middle Eastern crisis (2023‚Äìpresent)#Events by country has a main, more in-depth article except Middle Eastern crisis (2023‚Äìpresent)#Syria. I want to create an article detailing the spillover from strikes, statements, and especially the Recent ground operations, Israeli military constructions within Syrian territory (whcih also included resulted in some notable incidents. 
at the same time, I want it to be coordinated, and sure to be justified and in-form of the general Wikipedia mode of publication/operation.
Do I create a Draft and submit it somewhere? Or do I just create it and publish it after it is in enough depth? Or is there a specific place to discuss such matters?
please guide me as I want to be in line and to avoid wrongdoings. RamiPat (talk) 21:19, 14 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]

How does Mike Tyson‚Äôs article not mention he is a convicted rapist who spent 3 years in jail. Despite the article having a whole section on his ‚Äúlegal troubles‚Äù and mentioned other rape allegations- he was charged and convicted of rape in the 90s. This article is locked but this is a gross omission. 2607:FEA8:FF01:48D5:5DD:A820:1B1A:6CBB (talk) 03:21, 15 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]

The first sentence in Van Morrison's early life has six wikilinks, most of which strike me as redundant, serving only to clutter the article. Is there an experienced editor who can advise which if any should be removed? 

"George Ivan Morrison was born on 31 August 1945, at 125 [Hyndford Street], [Bloomfield], [Belfast], [Northern Ireland], as the only child of George Morrison, a [shipyard] electrician, and Violet Morrison (n√©e Stitt), who had been a singer and [tap dancer] in her youth."

Hello,

When I search for a page in the Vector Legacy skin, it only selects a couple articles at random when using the up and down arrows on my keyboard. The Vector 2022 skin doesn't exhibit the same behaviour. I have reproduced this issue on a couple of browsers.

Is this a bug? 

Thanks.

I am trying to get a birthday of Hamida Salim yet can't find any sources stating her full birthday, only 1922. I am just wondering how can I tell the reader that the woman's full birthday is unknown.

For clarification, I checked every single page and none of them state her full birthday, closest I could get is 1922.

the preface for the information on Castroville Texas is incorrect; the town was colonized by Henri Castro, not "alsatians".   The moniker "The Little Alsace of Texas" is a misnomer and came about when Ruth Lawler (then mayor and teacher at St. Louis Catholic School-see historical records) held a contest only for St. Louis Catholic Students.  Students were asked to submit a nickname for Castroville.  The winner was a Haby boy with ...the little alsace of texas...Castroville Council then adopted the moniker to promote tourism through segregation.

I was reading the ‚ÄúMethanogen‚Äù page when I saw a sentence in the ‚ÄúEcology‚Äù section (immediately after the ‚Äú21‚Äùfootnote), which would appear to be key, except that it appears not to make grammatical sense, and gives no obvious sense of what word or words are missing.
To wit: ‚ÄúMost of those environments are not categorized as extreme and thus methanogens that inhabit them.‚Äù (Something missing after ‚Äúthus‚Äù, perhaps?).
I looked for a way to contact the most recent editor of the page but that was beyond my Luddite skill level, so I searched and found this page.
Hopefully, I‚Äôm correct on this sentence and haven‚Äôt wasted your time. And hopefully someone will know the answer.

To who it may concern: I couldn‚Äôt find a more appropriate link to write this. I donated again either yesterday or the day before and have donated several years in a row to you but not only am I still getting the donation pop ups, but apparently I‚Äôm getting internet obstruction to Wikipedia and I‚Äôd like to know if it is Wikipedia that‚Äôs causing the problem with my latest Wikipedia result. In other words, is Wikipedia not recognizing my donation to your latest request and is doing something on their end to cause this new issue. I know-this sounds silly to think Wikipedia would do this, but it‚Äôs not happening with other internet pages I have open.  It‚Äôs cutting in and out at a very fast pace, sort of like a heartbeat, probably around 60-90 flickers per minute, and has a box notification about the Wikipedia internet interface and also has something about donations, but it‚Äôs flickering so fast I can‚Äôt read it all.  Or could you please direct me to the correct department for this matter?

Trying again. I need some help with the map overlay.

wikipedia used to be a great source of information. I've donated to you several times.  Now, I consistently see political bias garbage that does not belong in anything I search whether it be current events and people, or historical events.  I want the truth, not BS through an agenda filter. 

My question is- When exactly did you become so corrupt? Wikipedia didn't used to be this way. Were you paid or bribed, or was it of free will? 2600:6C5E:1E00:34E:55EE:385F:5BBF:DC (talk) 03:24, 17 November 2024 (UTC)[reply]

I can find deleted articles created by user by looking at their "articles created" at the bottom and the Xtools dash will show deleted articles as well.
